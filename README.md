# Museum-Search-API-App

This APP is build with React Native. It is a fully functional App for Android, optimized for Google Pixel 6. It collects Data from https://www.artic.edu/open-access/public-api which provides a free API and Data from different Museums. The App collects Data from the Website and represents it, in the User Interface, in a clear way. By choosing different filters you can manipulate the search results, for example you want to have a look at only pictures from Picasso or you just want to search for oil paintings and so on.
